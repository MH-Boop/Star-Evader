When you open the game you'll see the title, a bunch of names with numbers beside them. Those numbers
and names are high scores. you get the high scores from playing in 'free mode'. free mode is just
infinitely generating obstacles and you try to see how long you can last. you can see the other modes
by pressing the blue gear icon in the top right. there's 'easy' 'medium' 'hard' and 'free'.
you notice an astronaut icon below the gear that is the skin selection menu. Comprising of 
*drum roll* two skins... Either way it's more than one. The skin you choose effects the player
model when you press play. the main game when not in free mode lasts for 30 seconds. The difficutly 
affects the amount of stars that spawn and the player's speed. the red bar up top shows you how
much longer you need to last in order to win. oh and the slider with the blue square that's in the 
main menu is just a volume slider for the music.
