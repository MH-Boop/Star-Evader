hey guys if youre reading this, good!
i've been doing like 99% of the work on this project so far and even though I know i volunteered
to be the coder of this project. This is still a coding 'group' project. We're all in this class
to learn so it wouldn't be cool if I shoved you all away to learn for myself.(I'm also tired of
trying to figure out this whole game by myself) So all of you should still put in some of your
own code as well. I've done most of the hard stuff that you can look at. But I've also purposelly
let some features out as well. 
These include:

BUTTONS: when you open the game you'll see that the buttons leave a lot to desire. I'm hoping 
to clean them up and make them prettier. Such as changing color when hovering. And using a different
font. this is a link to a youtube video that should show how to make that:

DIFFERENT WIN SCREEN: so far when you finish the game it's just a 'you win!' along with buttons
to try again, go back to main menu, and close the game. I want to keep the buttons there. All 
I'm looking for is a different image. Since the whole game is about an astronaut and space, I'm
thinking a picture of the the astronaut and earth together (like he's back home) with a 'you win!'
message.

ADD SOUND: so far the only sounds are the button clicks, player hurt sound, and the music. Theres 
still a lot of sounds left to add such as: 
- sound when alien spawns
- sound when asteroid is falling
- sound when player uses speed boost
- victory sound
- sound when player gets hit by asteroid (i'm thinking like mechanical failure sound)
- sound when player gets hit by alien (like a balloon sound since the player is getting bigger)
- etc.

ADD PAUSE MENU: this is simplest. i think you should be able to pause the game at any point. 
just make an event action for a certain keys and pause the screen and give the buttons to go the 
main menu, continue, or close the game.

That's pretty much it! lmk if you read this and have any questions. and if it seems too 
complicated it's not. I've done this whole project using chatgpt for help (not copy pasting!) 
and youtube videos. it can really be as easy as copy pasting the code into chatgpt and 
telling it what you're trying to do. With that, please pick up your weight I hope I don't have
to lie when we do our peer evaluations. I've given you 90% all i'm asking for is the last 10%. The only files you should need to downlaod are main.py, settings.py, and volume_settings.py. and the folders 'gamepics' and sounds' have the music and images. remember to use 'forking' with git (code with your stuff added to mine) and then send me it for me to look at and i'll add it to the project.
